# SET_Thesis
Repository for my MSc. SET thesis "Reinforcement Learning Methodology for Electricity Market Design".

The code here is currently "under construction" and thus NOT guaranteed to work out-of-the-box.
Similarly, the thesis PDF is an early draft.  For now, please see this for more details about the project.
